# Batch Apex
A Batch Apex class consists of three methods:
- **start method:** This method returns a Database.QueryLocator object that identifies the records to process. The start method is called once at the beginning of the batch job.
- **execute method:** This method processes a batch of records. The execute method is called multiple times during the batch job, with each call processing a batch of records.
- **finish method:** This method is called once at the end of the batch job. It is used to perform any final cleanup or reporting.

## Best Practices
- Use the Database.QueryLocator object to efficiently process large data sets.
- Use the Database.Stateful interface to maintain state between batch executions. This is useful if you need to maintain a running total or need to keep track of processed records.
- Use the Database.AllowsCallouts interface if you need to make web service calls during the batch job.
- Use the System.abortJob method to gracefully stop a running batch job if needed.
- Handle exceptions carefully, as any uncaught exception will cause the entire batch job to fail.
- Consider using batch chaining or parallelization to further optimize the processing of large data sets.
- Use bulkified code and efficient queries to improve performance.

### Syntax:
```apex
public class MyBatch implements Database.Batchable<sObject> {
    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
        // Start method logic here
    }
    
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List<sObject> scope) {
        // Execute method logic here
    }
    
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
        // Finish method logic here
    }
}
```
